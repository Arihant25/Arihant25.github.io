It’s Oscar here. I am 5 years old. I was brought into my current home from an orphanage a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*uFKxHLRqt56uC6WZjrGwOg.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was just lying on my back and staring at the sky when I heard footsteps coming toward me. I jumped up with excitement and started yelping loudly. I saw a little human boy of fewer than 10 years of age approach toward me. I could see the freckles on his cheeks. He smiled at me and showed me his pearly white teeth. We looked at each other longingly for a moment, and then he called out to his parents, who were talking with the owner of the orphanage. “I like this one!”, the boy exclaimed happily. The boy’s parents smiled at him approvingly and signalled to the owner. He came over to my cage and opened it, upon which I rushed over to the boy and jumped onto his open arms. “Careful, Max!”, his mother called out to him. Max was a little startled because of my weight, but in a few moments held me comfortably, as if we had been doing this for years. They took me home in their small but cosy car. I looked at the scenery outside for the first time. It was a small and dainty town. There were very few cars and other vehicles on the road. There were beautiful parks with colourful flowers everywhere. I was mesmerised, seeing all this for the first time. I never knew a world like this existed outside of my orphanage. After a few hours, we reached my new home. It was a tiny house. It had a small garden on the front and a garage where Max’s father parked the car. Max took me inside the room and showed me all the rooms. He also showed me his toys. Everything was so complicated and confusing. There was a black box on a table, which sometimes showed colourful pictures when there were people sitting in front of it. There was a weird circular thing on the wall, which made ticking noises all the time! There was a tall box (which was bigger than the previous black box), which had all kinds of delicious food in it. It made my mouth water just by looking at it. I was happy to finally be in a family who loved me!</p>
<p>But everything changed after a few weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was just getting used to my new life in the house. The regular walks with Max, the delicious meals I got to eat, the wonderful new things I got to see, all of it. I thought it would last forever. But then misfortune struck. Max fell ill. He became bed-ridden. He couldn’t play with me anymore. He spent most of his time lying and closing his eyes. Relatives from all over came to see him. Many doctors came too. But they all left with sad and sullen faces. All around the house, there were whispers of only one word, ‘<em>Cancer’</em>.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what it meant then, and I still don’t now. But at that time, it meant I couldn’t enjoy my life with Max anymore. One day, I felt something weird. I was lying half-asleep on the floor of Max’s room. It was a dark and cloudy day. I barked loudly at Max, but he didn’t respond. He didn’t so much as stir on his bed. I rushed to his parents and barked hurriedly at them. They immediately knew something was wrong. They followed me to Max’s room.</p>
<p>He lay very still.</p>
<p>I still live with Max’s parents now. They take good care of me, just like before. I am the only thing stopping them from falling to the depths of depression and misery. I am their only hope now.</p>
