I learnt it the hard way. See, no one told me that there would be such a big <em>gap</em> between the difficulty level of class 10 and class 11.</p>
<p>Nah, scratch that — many people told me. Told me to steer clear of the science stream and take <em>anything</em> else. But I chose to ignore them, if it wasn’t evident already, and here we are now. How could I have avoided the life changing pursuit of Science? The only reason humanity has progressed from the Stone Age to the Modern age is because people dared to push boundaries, discover and invent new stuff constantly. Little did I know that the vision of Science I had in my fantasies and the reality of entrance exams were poles apart. My parents are dentists, so it would have made perfect sense for me to take the Medical stream too. But I’ve been in a steady long-term relationship with Computer Science for a while now (it’s going great, thanks for asking), so I couldn’t settle for anything else.</p>

<p>Remember that two-week long holiday the schools gave us, starting March 13, 2020, because of some ‘coronavirus’ causing havoc in China? Yeah, that didn’t last two weeks. Two years, more like. Our 10th Boards got cancelled due to the pandemic. So, I just jumped from reading 10th grade trigonometry one day to starting 11th grade Units and Dimensions in physics the next. At first, the chapters were somewhat easy; then, like a shadow act with higher stakes, they slowly crept up on me menacingly, catching me unaware in the process. In my defence, though, I kept studying regularly despite the hurdles (even if for just a couple hours on some days). Online classes were just not as effective as the real deal.</p>
<p>Then, in twelfth grade, schools finally opened. Like that one English chapter in the class 9 NCERT, The Fun They Had, we had spent a long time adjusting to Zoom screens and frequent “Am I audible sir’s?”. (“I am Narcissus and my little Zoom square is my lake.”) I was very relieved to head back there, as I had been missing my school life for two years. Once school started, I fell into a rhythm of waking up early, attending classes regularly, and revising what was taught in the class. I didn’t have to think much about what to study because the school’s timetable was enough. It became muscle memory after a point.</p>
<p>One eternity later, it was December. Preboards were almost upon us, and that was also when the NTA (National Testing Agency) declared the JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) dates, which were to be held in January and April. I had expected they would be held in April and after, so I was once again caught off-guard. I tried to prioritise both Boards and JEE, but figured since I only had one chance to give the Boards, I should make the most of it. In the end, I scored 94.2% in Boards (with a full 100 in CS). Not bad, if I do say so myself. My subjects were Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Computer Science and Painting.</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*5pIiI6bnsDTy0TDG" alt="My percentages in the same tests."></p>
<p>After a relatively dismal performance in the first JEE (91.88 percentile), and even worse in the second (90.2), I still didn’t lose hope — because in the November of 2022, I had found out about the UGEE (Undergraduate Entrance Examination) and had that as my main goal. In fact, I was intermittently giving UGEE mock tests alongside JEE mock tests even before the April session of JEE. Then, I finally gave UGEE on May 6, and it went well (95/150). The cutoff was 90. Truth be told, I relaxed after that and didn’t prepare <em>that</em> seriously for BITSAT (Birla Institute of Technology and Science Admission Test for BITS Pilani). I scored 209 there in the first attempt and even less in the second. (Something of a trend there…)</p>
<p>In VIT I had got a rank of around 8000, in Manipal and KIIT, somewhere around 700–800. I had qualified for JEE Advance but couldn’t clear the cutoff for IITs. I was getting VIT Vellore CS with specialisation in Information Security, which I was keeping as my backup, and Manipal and KIIT CS too.</p>
<p>Then, on 13th June, I had my interview for IIIT Hyderabad. There I was asked a couple Science questions which I answered more or less correctly, and after a week, I found out my rank. I had chosen B Tech + MS in Computer Science as my first preference, so that’s what I got.</p>

<p>Now, coming to one of the primary reasons I wrote this article. During the class 11 final exams, I decided to track the amount of time I spent studying, so I could procrastinate less and find out where all my time actually goes. I did my research and found out about an app called Toggl Track (not sponsored, sadly) that did exactly what I wanted. I stopped tracking my time one day before the Preboards and before I started giving any mock tests for JEE.</p>
<p>The total tracked time is 1291 hours, 21 minutes, and 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Below are the results from this entire exercise, in the hope that future students might analyse these and find them useful. One such interesting insight I found is that my average time of one sitting is just 38 minutes.</p>
<p>These are divided subject wise:</p>

<p>And below is a PDF containing detailed information about the amount of time spent studying each chapter of each subject. If there’s one link you click in this entire article, I highly recommend it to be this one. Maybe you’ll get surprised by what you see?</p>

<p>Bonus: In the course of my studies, I found two chapters very intriguing — class 11’s Structure of Atom and Chemical Bonding in Chemistry. To understand them better, I made my own notes for them by consulting various sources. It took almost an entire week to write each chapter’s notes. The good thing was that since the chapters are related, they also helped me in class 12’s Atoms and Nuclei in Physics.</p>
<p>Here are the notes so you might benefit from them as much as I did:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A lot of people are asking me how best to prepare for UGEE. Well, I can’t really advise you specifically, because everyone has their own style and what worked for me may not work for you. However, what I can tell you is that I did not study anything extra for the SUPR part of UGEE. The Boards syllabus was more or less enough, with maybe a concept or two I learned throughout my JEE preparation. Also, in my time there was no negative marking in SUPR, so I could guess whenever I was unsure. It more of a game of speed than of accuracy. And finally, for REAP, I felt like all the questions required just common sense. There wasn’t much to prepare for there. One thing I would suggest you though, is to give mock tests. As many as you can. Now I could tell you exactly which mock tests to do, but since you’re planning on doing a research degree, you should be able to search up on your own. Besides, you can’t go wrong with any one because they’re more or less the same. You just need an idea of how prepared you are, and work accordingly.</p>
