        <h2>Monkey See, Monkey Do</h2>

        <p>
            This particular experiment was carried out with monkeys, but I'm pretty sure it can be extended to apply to
            humans too.
        </p>
        <ol>

            <li>A group of scientists placed 5 monkeys in a cage and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every
                time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others beat up the one on the ladder. No
                monkey
                dared to go up the ladder after some time, regardless of the temptation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scientists then decided to substitute one of the monkeys. The first thing this new monkey did was to go
                up
                the
                ladder. Immediately the other monkeys beat him up. After several beatings, the new member learned not to
                climb the ladder even though it never knew why.
            </li>
            <li>
                A second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated on the beating for
                the
                second
                monkey. A third monkey was changed and the same was repeated (beating). The fourth was substituted and
                the
                beating was repeated. Finally, the fifth monkey was replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
                What was left was a group of 5 monkeys that even though never received a cold shower, continued to beat
                up
                any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Even though the cold showers, the punishment, were stopped a long time back, the behavior of the monkeys
            went on unquestioningly, unblinkingly. "Thats how things are done around here!" they would have protested,
            had they been asked what the purpose of all those beatings was.
            Monkey see, monkey do. Monkey jump off cliff if his monkey friend jumps off first. Monkey no think.
        </p>
